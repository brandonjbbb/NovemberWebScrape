Web Scraping and NLP Project

Description

This project showcases techniques in web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) using Python. It includes:

Token and lemma frequency analysis
Sentence scoring
Data visualization through histograms
Utilization of libraries like spaCy, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, and more
The project demonstrates the application of NLP concepts for text analysis and provides reproducible steps for similar data extraction tasks.
